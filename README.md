# 🔐 Crypto Message App

![App Preview](screenshot.png)

> “Encrypt or not to encrypt... there is no try.” – inspired by Master Yoda 🧙‍♂️✨

This is a simple and interactive Streamlit app that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using cryptographic algorithms like AES and RSA.

## 🚀 Features

- ✉️ Encrypt and decrypt messages
- 🔐 Support for symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption
- 🧪 Simple interface for learning and testing cryptography concepts
- 🛡️ Focus on data protection and privacy

## 🔍 How it works

This app lets you enter any message and encrypt or decrypt it using:

- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** – a symmetric encryption algorithm. You use the same key to encrypt and decrypt.
- **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)** – an asymmetric encryption algorithm. You encrypt with a public key and decrypt with a private key.

It’s a hands-on way to understand how modern cryptography works in practice.
